# Chain me up (Ableton Effect Rack)
This is an attempt at creating a custom Effect Rack that should be good for any type of 808, bass or synth.

Includes 4 chain options.

## Requirements
- Ableton Live 12.0.0 or above
- SerumFX plugin (32-bit vst)

## How to use
- First, select which chain you would like to use with the "Chain Select" macro.
- Then, dial in how much of the chain's effect you would like to use with the macro that corresponds to your chain selection.
- Finally, use the "Limiter" macro to taste.
  - (RECOMMENDED: These effects can be LOUD)

If you want, you could also select the (R) button to the left of the rack's name for a completely randomized selection for each macro, excluding the "Limiter" macro.

## Installation
### Windows
- First, locate your Ableton User Library.
  - To do this, open Ableton Live and select Options > Preferences > Library
  - Under "Content Locations", you will find your User Library's directory under the option "Location of User Library".
